# My Journal

My Journal is a journaling (or blogging) web application. Any user can quickly create an account with only an email and password, and start posting their own journal entries. The application supports all essential CRUD operations by which users can freely create, view, edit, and delete their journal entries. All journal entries are timestamped and can be made private or public. The latest public journal entries are viewable on the application's homepage. 

The application stores and interacts with data with on a PostgreSQL database.
The frontend was built with ReactJS and the backend with Node/ExpressJS.

Currently the web application is not deployed.
